# 🎯 Final Setup - Clean and Organized

## ✅ What We've Done

### 1. **Created Single Unified Tool**
- `vulkan-ml-sdk` - One tool for everything
- No more confusion with multiple scripts
- Clean, professional interface

### 2. **Organized Directory Structure**
```
Vulkan/
├── vulkan-ml-sdk         # Main tool (all commands)
├── README.md            # Project overview
├── .gitignore          # Git configuration
├── .gitmodules         # Submodule links
├── docs/               # Documentation
│   ├── README.md
│   └── QUICK_START.md
├── scripts/            # Helper scripts
├── archive/            # Old files (can delete)
└── [6 SDK submodules]  # Your ARM ML SDK repos
```

### 3. **Simplified Workflow**

All commands now through one tool:

```bash
# Daily workflow
./vulkan-ml-sdk status      # Check what's changed
./vulkan-ml-sdk save "msg"  # Commit and push
./vulkan-ml-sdk sync        # Get ARM updates

# Development
./vulkan-ml-sdk build       # Build SDK
./vulkan-ml-sdk test        # Run tests
./vulkan-ml-sdk clean       # Clean builds

# Advanced
./vulkan-ml-sdk branch feature/name  # Create branch
./vulkan-ml-sdk info                 # Show info
```

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Simple**: One tool, clear commands
2. **Clean**: No clutter, organized structure
3. **Professional**: Ready for serious development
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to update and extend
