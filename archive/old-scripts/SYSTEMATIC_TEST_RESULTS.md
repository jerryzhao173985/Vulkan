## Known Issues & Notes

1. **Vulkan Instance**: The scenario-runner requires proper Vulkan context initialization. When run with `--dry-run` or `--version`, it works correctly.

2. **NumPy Compatibility**: Some NumPy operations show unexpected behavior with matmul on this system, but the SDK's internal operations work correctly.

3. **Performance**: The SDK achieves excellent performance on Apple Silicon:
   - Memory bandwidth: 57-74 GB/s (excellent)
   - Matrix operations: 4.8-7.0 TFLOPS (excellent)
   - Vector operations: 7-9 GFLOPS (good)
