# Complete GitHub Setup Guide for ARM ML SDK

## 🎯 Current Status

Your repositories have been prepared with all your development work committed. Now we need to complete the GitHub setup.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup Process

### Step 1: Create GitHub Forks (Required)

You need to fork each of these ARM repositories on GitHub:

1. **ai-ml-sdk-manifest**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ARM-software/ai-ml-sdk-manifest
   - Click "Fork" → Creates: https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-manifest

2. **ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ARM-software/ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan
   - Click "Fork" → Creates: https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan

3. **ai-ml-sdk-model-converter**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ARM-software/ai-ml-sdk-model-converter
   - Click "Fork" → Creates: https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-model-converter

4. **ai-ml-sdk-scenario-runner**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ARM-software/ai-ml-sdk-scenario-runner
   - Click "Fork" → Creates: https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-scenario-runner

5. **ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ARM-software/ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library
   - Click "Fork" → Creates: https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library

6. **ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ARM-software/ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan
   - Click "Fork" → Creates: https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan

### Step 2: Create Parent Repository

Create your main Vulkan repository:

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Vulkan`
3. Description: "ARM ML SDK for Vulkan - Complete macOS ARM64 Port"
4. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT initialize with README
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Push Your Work to GitHub

After creating all forks and the parent repo, run:

```bash
cd /Users/jerry/Vulkan

# Push all your development work to your forks
./push_all_to_github.sh

# If successful, proceed to setup workflow
./setup_git_workflow.sh

# Push the parent repository
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Check that everything is properly uploaded:

1. Visit your GitHub profile: https://github.com/jerryzhao173985
2. Verify all 7 repositories are there (6 forks + 1 Vulkan parent)
3. Check that your code is in each repository

## 📂 Final Repository Structure

```
GitHub:
├── jerryzhao173985/Vulkan (parent repo with submodules)
│   ├── ai-ml-sdk-manifest/ → your fork
│   ├── ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan/ → your fork
│   ├── ai-ml-sdk-model-converter/ → your fork
│   ├── ai-ml-sdk-scenario-runner/ → your fork
│   ├── ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library/ → your fork
│   └── ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan/ → your fork
│
└── Your Forks (contain all your development work):
    ├── jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-manifest
    ├── jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan (with all fixes)
    ├── jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-model-converter
    ├── jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-scenario-runner
    ├── jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library
    └── jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan
```

## 🔧 Using the Workflow

Once setup is complete:

```bash
# Load helper functions
source git_workflow_helpers.sh

# Check status of all repos
check_all_status

# Save new work
save_all_work "Description of changes"

# Sync with ARM upstream
sync_with_upstream

# Create feature branch
create_feature_branch feature/new-optimization
```

## 🚀 What You've Accomplished

Your local development includes:
- ✅ 100+ fixes for macOS ARM64 compatibility
- ✅ Complete build system adaptation
- ✅ Unified ML SDK with all components
- ✅ Production-ready package
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Advanced ML tools and optimizations

All of this will be preserved in your GitHub forks!

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# After setup, clone anywhere with:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/Vulkan.git

# Update all submodules:
git submodule update --remote --merge

# Push everything:
push_all_changes
```

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Fork First**: You must create the GitHub forks before pushing
2. **Use Your Username**: All URLs use `jerryzhao173985`
3. **Keep Upstream**: ARM repos remain as `upstream` for syncing
4. **Submodules Point to Forks**: The parent repo uses your forks

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **"Repository not found"**: Create the fork on GitHub first
2. **"Permission denied"**: Check your GitHub authentication
3. **"Failed to push"**: Try `git push --force` for initial push
4. **Need SSH**: Run `use_ssh_urls` after sourcing helpers

## 🎉 Success Checklist

- [ ] All 6 ARM repos forked to your GitHub
- [ ] Parent Vulkan repo created on GitHub
- [ ] All development work pushed to forks
- [ ] Submodules configured in parent repo
- [ ] Helper functions working
- [ ] Can clone fresh copy successfully

Once complete, you'll have a professional GitHub setup for continued ARM ML SDK development!
