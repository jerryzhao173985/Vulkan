# Upstream Sync Guide for ARM ML SDK

## ✅ Sync Capability Confirmed!

Your Git workflow is properly configured to sync with upstream ARM repositories while maintaining your own development.

## 📊 Current Configuration

### Remote Setup for Each Repository

All your submodules have two remotes configured:

1. **`origin`** → Your GitHub forks (jerryzhao173985/*)
   - Where you push your changes
   - Contains all your macOS fixes

2. **`upstream`** → ARM official repositories (ARM-software/*)
   - Source of official updates
   - Read-only access for syncing

### Example Remote Configuration
```
origin    → https://github.com/jerryzhao173985/ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan.git
upstream  → https://github.com/ARM-software/ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan.git
```

## 🔄 How to Sync with Upstream

### Method 1: Sync All Repositories at Once

```bash
cd /Users/jerry/Vulkan
source git_workflow_helpers.sh
sync_with_upstream
```

This will:
1. Fetch from all upstream repos
2. Merge upstream/main into your main
3. Push updates to your forks

### Method 2: Sync Individual Repository

```bash
# Example: Sync ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan
cd ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan

# 1. Fetch latest from ARM
git fetch upstream

# 2. Checkout your main branch
git checkout main

# 3. Merge ARM's changes
git merge upstream/main

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Check Before Syncing

```bash
# See what's new in upstream
git fetch upstream
git log main..upstream/main --oneline

# Or see the differences
git diff main upstream/main --stat
```

## 🛠️ Handling Merge Conflicts

If ARM makes changes to files you've modified:

```bash
# 1. Attempt merge
git merge upstream/main

# 2. If conflicts occur
git status  # See conflicted files

# 3. Edit files to resolve conflicts
# Look for <<<<<<< markers

# 4. Mark as resolved
git add <resolved-files>

# 5. Complete merge
git commit
git push origin main
```

## 📋 Workflow Example

### Scenario: ARM releases an update

1. **Check for updates**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jerry/Vulkan
   source git_workflow_helpers.sh
   check_all_status
   ```

2. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   sync_with_upstream
   ```

3. **Continue your development**:
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   # ...
   save_all_work "My new features"
   ```

## 🎯 Benefits of This Setup

1. **Stay Updated**: Get ARM's bug fixes and new features
2. **Preserve Your Work**: Your macOS fixes remain intact
3. **Clean History**: Clear separation between ARM's work and yours
4. **Easy Contribution**: Can create PRs back to ARM when ready

## 🔍 Current Status

- ✅ All remotes properly configured
- ✅ Sync functions available via helpers
- ✅ Your forks are independent
- ✅ Can pull from ARM anytime
- ✅ Your changes are preserved

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Always sync before major work**: Reduces merge conflicts
2. **Test after syncing**: Ensure ARM changes don't break your fixes
3. **Document conflicts**: Keep notes on recurring merge issues
4. **Consider branches**: For experimental upstream syncs

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Load helpers
source git_workflow_helpers.sh

# Check everything
check_all_status

# Sync all
sync_with_upstream

# Save your work
save_all_work "Description"

# Create feature branch
create_feature_branch feature/new-stuff
```

Your upstream sync capability is fully functional and ready to use! 🎉
