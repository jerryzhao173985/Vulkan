## üîç Repository Details

| Repository | Branch | Status | Commits |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|
| ai-ml-sdk-manifest | main | clean | Ready |
| ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan | main | clean | All fixes committed |
| ai-ml-sdk-model-converter | main | clean | Ready |
| ai-ml-sdk-scenario-runner | main | clean | Ready |
| ai-ml-sdk-vgf-library | main | clean | Ready |
| ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan | main | clean | Ready |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Warnings

1. **`.gitmodules` not yet created** - This is normal and will be created by the setup script when configuring submodules.

## üöÄ Ready for Next Steps

The verification confirms that your setup is **completely ready** for GitHub upload:

1. ‚úÖ All development work is committed
2. ‚úÖ Git remotes are properly configured
3. ‚úÖ Documentation is complete
4. ‚úÖ Scripts are tested and working
5. ‚úÖ No uncommitted changes

## üìã Next Actions

1. **Create GitHub Forks** (if not already done):
   - Visit each ARM repository and click "Fork"
   - Ensure all 6 forks exist under `jerryzhao173985`

2. **Create Parent Repository**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `Vulkan`
   - Do NOT initialize with README

3. **Run the Setup Wizard**:
   ```bash
   ./github_setup_wizard.sh
   ```

This will:
- Push all your work to GitHub
- Configure submodules
- Set up the complete workflow

## üéØ Conclusion

Your ARM ML SDK port to macOS ARM64 is fully prepared and ready to be preserved on GitHub. All the hard work of fixing 100+ compilation errors, creating the unified SDK, and building the production package is safely committed and ready to share with the world!
